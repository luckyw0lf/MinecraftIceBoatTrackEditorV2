# MinecraftIceBoatTrackEditorV2
A remake of my MinecraftIceBoatTrackEditor , after remaking this, there will be an integration with TimingSystem from Makkuusen

This is a W.I.P. recreation of my MinecraftIceBoatTrackEditor
On my profile you will find the first version of it and THE INSTRUCTIONS.
IT IS FOR NOW BETTER TO USE THE ORIGINAL ONE https://github.com/luckyw0lf/MinecraftIceBoatTrackEditor
The reason for me remaking this is because the first version was very unoptimised.
Seccond reasoning is that I will try with Makkuusen to intergrate this generator with his timingsystem

Thanks for reading (:
